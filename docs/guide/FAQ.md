## I can't use the Open In Editor feature

The feature is based on the [vite-plugin-vue-inspector](https://github.com/webfansplz/vite-plugin-vue-inspector) plugin and requires configuration, which you can do by looking at the [configuration documentation](https://github.com/webfansplz/vite-plugin-vue-inspector?tab=readme-ov-file#--configuration-ide--editor).
